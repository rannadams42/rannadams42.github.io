One of my favorite quotes that I always find myself referring to is "Not all those who wonder are lost; The old that is storng does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost" from J.R.R. Tolkien. With all my endevors, I find myself wandering for a long time until I eventually found my purpose. Sometimes, the wandering journey seems linear or non-linear. Sometimes, the journey seems circular (rather most journeys feel like that). 

I felt that I have done a bit of wondering, but it was all well intentioned and for the best. I came in with the strong intent in working on additive manufacturing and energy related applications. I remember that I was adamant about working with electrochemistry for instance. It was definitely a true passion that I was feeling
namely because I came out from doing a class in undergrad that focused on rocket propulsion. Therefore, after several interviews with a couple of professors, I found the lab I was able to "vibe" with. The two labs that I interviewed allowed me to talk with their students in particular so I was able to get a feel for the lab. 

Once I got started with my PhD journey in the fall, I was very introverted to communicating with others. However, I always made sure to have a plan for everything that I did. I wanted to be as much ahead of the game as possible as I understood the PhD journey is more intense. Therefore, I needed to be more mentally prepared. That, in part, led me to join multiple organizations and is one of the reasons why I have multiple slack channels. 

## The revelation of lab-switching and politely asking for what I want

During the Fall semester, there were times that I got distracted. I typically get distracted, but I was more distracted than usual because of the late hours I was working and the difficulty I was having in understanding some aspects of the project I was working on. Also, I felt that I would be restricted and realized almost immediately there would be no creative control on my end. I found myself longing to work with polymers and biology, especially on the nanoscale, and tackling similar concepts in soft matter that I did in undergraduate. Therefore, I graviated towards papers that focused on the rational design of proteins. Strangely, they became comfort papers similar to the astronomy books I could not let go of during kindergarden. Then I went down a rabbit-hole and found a whole new field DNA nanostructures and DNA nanotechnology. I was fascinated that one can design various constructs using DNA alone, and I found myself going deeper into the literature to understand the field of DNA nanotechnology. I wanted to learn more and understand the role that Dna nanostructures can play in drug delivery.

Then it hit me. "Wait, who in MechE works on this? I feel like I met them before?"

I remember the pivotal point when it clicked that I needed to switch. It was around Thanksgiving (Nov. 26th) when I forced myself to write the email to express my decision to switch labs. I remember it was a stressful time because (1) I had to do qualifying exams within a year of entering in the PhD program and this switch would set me back a year and (2) I did not want my faculty advisor at the time and lab members to feel as if they had done something wrong (they are all quite kind and I still catch up with them this day!) But, this was one of the times I had to put one of my father's teachings at the forefront of my mind, which is "be firm in asking for what you want." It also happens to be a Christian principle, which gave me twice the conviction. So after a series of emails and nervous meetings, I was able to join Professor Rebecca Taylor's lab. 

## Adventures in a multidisciplinary advisor sitatuation 

I was nervous about the transition because I was scared that the current lab members would find me to be "eccentric" or not very serious, especially since I switched labs. But luckily, I made a friend with one of the lab members via a engineering math class before switching classes and consider her as one of my mentors and friend till this day. Therefore, making the switch to Prof. Taylor's lab was smoother. Also, I heard many good things about my new advisor. It was the first time I felt comfortable asking questions and just being *myself*.  Therefore, now, I feel more productive I have ever been in her lab in particular. I also like that I can talk to Prof. Taylor comfortably about different personal subjects and potential outreach opportunities apart from the cool research findings in the field of nanobiotehcnology and manufacturing. 

It was interesting reconnecting with my now co-advisor, Professor Burak Ozdoganlar. But I remember he mentioned several things that essentially lit a fire of willpower. He mentioned a list of several things that I should do and be an expert in and mentioned that I should be **self-motivated**. I had a feeling that there are possibly low expectations since I switched labs. So, that's when I wanted to *prove* that I am not only self-motivated, but that I can exceed expectations without mentally draining myself. This means doing what is asked of me and *more*. It doesn't mean digging myself into the ground, but it really taught me how to work efficiently and effectively without burning myself out immediately. Also, I had to flip a switch and be mentally tough while striking a life balance. It essence, it made me less scared of him and more confident in meetings.

What I love, however, is now I have creative control over my project, more or less, since I am the first one to work on it. That is something that gives me purpose in life above anything else.

## Putting myself out there (in a good way)
