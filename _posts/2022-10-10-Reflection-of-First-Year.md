# Looking Back at my first year at Carnegie Mellon

One of my favorite quotes that I always find myself referring to is "all that are wonder are not truly lost". 

I felt that I have done a bit of wondering, but it was all well intentioned and for the best. I came in with the strong intent in working on additive manufacturing
and energy related applications. I remember that I was adamant about working with electrochemistry for instance. It was definitely a true passion that I was feeling
namely because I came out from doing a class in undergrad that focused on rocket propulsion. Therefore, after several interviews with a couple of professors, I found the
lab I was able to "vibe" with. The two labs that I interviewed allowed me to talk with their students in particular so I was able to get a feel for the lab. 

Once I got started with my PhD journey in the fall, I was very introverted to communicating with others. However, I always made sure to have a plan for everything that I did. 
I wanted to be as much ahead of the game as possible as I understood the PhD journey is more intense. 

I eventually joined Professor Rebecca Taylor's lab. Because I am co-advised with Dr. Burak Ozdoganlar, I wound up joining his lab too. In essense, I find myself caught between 
two worlds, and that is both a positive and negative thing. It's positive because I am growing interdisciplinary
