I never thought that I would find myself working with DNA during my Ph.D. program. But I guess it proves how interdisciplinary research is in engineering where even a Mechanical Enigneering student would find themselves working in the field of biotechnology. When starting off on my project, I never really appreciated how flexible and complex DNA was until now. 

# Fundamentals of DNA and it's importance in engineering

DNA is a biological macromolecule that stores genetic information and transmit it to the next generation. 

## Structure and function

DNA is made up of nucleotides. For those who are into polymer science, you can compare nucleotides to monomers and DNA to polymers assembled by these monomers through enzymatic reaction. The nucleotides that make up DNA are separated into two classes. There are the purines, which are nucleotides that have two bezene rings (adenine and guanine), and the pyrimidines, which are nucleotides with one benzene ring (cytosine, thymine, and uracil). For DNA, adenenine pairs with thymine and cytosine pairs with guanine. These pairings are energetically favorable given their respective sturctures. The ratio of purines to pyrimidines are 1:1 and ratios of A-T and C-G are also 1:1. 

DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. This is because DNA has a hydrogen on the second carbon of the sugar. The carbon atoms on the sugar are numbered clockwise from 1 to 5. The 3' and 5' carbon are very important as they appear at the end of the nucleotide sequence.

There are several structural motifs. There is the A-duplex, B-duplex, and X-duplex. Another set of conformations include the hairpin, triplex, and G-quadruplex. 

## Application

DNA has shown potential as a structural biomaterial. It has been retooled to artificial recognition agents and structural scaffolds for applications in material science, biophysical research and synthetic biology.
