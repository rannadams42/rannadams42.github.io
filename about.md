### About me

My name is Rebekah Adams and I am a Ph.D. student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University. I studied Chemical and Biological Engineering at Princeton University along with two certificates in Engineering Biology and Biophysics. Apart from doing scientific research, I write, read science fiction and historical fiction novels, exercise, draw, knit, and listen or play classical and 80s music. But I am ultimately very passionate about STEM outreach and encouraging students from underpresented or underpriviledged backgrounds to pursue science (especially as I believe we need more creative and skilled scientists and engineers). This page serves as a digital academic diary, logging the meticulous journey to become a research scientist. I hope that those who follow will learn a lot from my writings.
